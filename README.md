# Hi there 👋

<!--
**NelCapeTown/NelCapeTown** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m working on a hobby project in my own time.  It will create an easy to use time capture utility that uses data from my Notion workspace and helps me to seamlessly log how I'm spending my time.
- 🌱 I’m also preparing to write required exams to become Microsoft Azure certified.  
- 👯 I was looking to collaborate on at least one thing during this Hacktoberfest.  The reality is that I need to get better at making time specifically for open source contributions.  I need to shuffle my priorities a little bit.
- 💬 Ask me about MS SQL, .NET with C#, algorithms/coding patterns and getting older...
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="mailto:cprinsloo@dvt.co.za">cprinsloo@dvt.co.za</a>
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Zen place is where I go while cleaning my house 🧼🧽🧹  There is something very soothing about mopping floors, washing dishes, and getting rid of clutter - I guess it's like "wax on, wax off..."
